## Introduction
1. **Problem Situation** - The setting of the problem is the landscape of the NBA. The direct stakeholders are the team's players and the coaches. The indirect stakeholders are fans, investors and people that bet. Two values that are in play are winning and money because teams will not pay or target good older players; instead they would intentionally try to loose in order to gain higher draft pick and plan for their future and disregard the short term. The general issues at stake is fan experience because if a team is not doing well then fans won't attend games. The ethical issues are fans are paying to watching teams and if the team is intentionally trying to play bad then that is a poor product for the fan. Some other work that has been done on this is player analysis. We are building on this work by taking multiple data sets that have to do with fan experience and player performance and finding a correlation between the two. We care about this problem because, all three of us are fans of basketball and we want to understand teams better from an analytical perspective better.
