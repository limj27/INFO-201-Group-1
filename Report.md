## Introduction
1. **Problem Situation** - The setting of the problem is the landscape of the NBA. The direct stakeholders are the team's players and the coaches. The indirect stakeholders are fans, investors and people that bet. Two values that are in play are winning and money because teams will not pay or target good older players; instead they would intentionally try to loose in order to gain higher draft pick and plan for their future and disregard the short term. The general issues at stake is fan experience because if a team is not doing well then fans won't attend games. The ethical issues are fans are paying to watching teams and if the team is intentionally trying to play bad then that is a poor product for the fan. Some other work that has been done on this is player analysis. We are building on this work by taking multiple data sets that have to do with fan experience and player performance and finding a correlation between the two. We care about this problem because, all three of us are fans of basketball and we want to understand teams better from an analytical perspective better.  

2. **What is the Problem?** - The specific problem that is at stake here is whether the sports analysis that teams use are actually helping the fan experience of each team in the NBA.

3. **Why does it matter?** - This matters because it can create a collateral damage to numerous stakeholders that are acquainted with the team itself. If the teams overall performances are suffering, then the financials of the team will be affected along with the fan attendance. This is important because the sports is a big part of American culture and pretty much can be seen as a driving force in the divided society.

4. **How will it be addressed?** - We will address this problem by analyzing the Fan Attendance and Revenue and see how the financials are doing compared to the fan attendance. Then analyze the fan attendance with the winning percentage to see how the performance of teams affects the fan attendance. We will be comparing fan attendance with revenue and winning percentage of each year and see the trends for every NBA team, which we will use a scatterplot to wrangle the data together. The main audience of our work would be the NBA team's itself for them to see how it is affecting their fan experience or even the fans if they want to switch teams to a team that has a better fan experience overall.

### Appendix 2: Reflections
* Justin Lim: It was interesting to say the least to see the data when it was combined which meant more than just words in my opinion. I found it frustrating to find the data for all the teams in the past years, we had to piece together information that was scattered to make it work. However, what I was satisfied about was that I was able to use what I have learned throughout the quarter in full action, I felt like I now have a pretty good grip on what data science is all about. What I would do differently next time is to get a head start and find concrete data values that are reliable rather than having to piece data together to find what we want. This project allowed me to learn more about data wrangling and create a shiny application through R which definitely helped me as a coder. Also, being able to think more critically to come up with data visualization that is effective.
